# 🥰 Emotional Support Chatroom

A real-time Emotional Support Chatroom built with a modern multi-service architecture and deployed on an Azure Virtual Machine using Docker Compose.

This project integrates:

- WordPress — front-end website & chatroom UI
- Node.js API — backend WebSocket server for real-time messaging
- Nginx — reverse proxy and unified entry point
- Docker Compose — orchestrates and manages all services

---

## Features

- Real-time chat powered by WebSocket
- WordPress-based UI for easy management and customization  
- Node.js backend handling WebSocket connections and broadcasting
- Nginx reverse proxy routing traffic to WordPress and the API  
- Fully containerized deployment with Docker Compose
- Designed to run continuously on Azure VM with minimal maintenance

## ▶ How to Run (on Azure VM)

1. Make sure Docker is installed
```bash
docker --version
docker compose --version
```

2. Start all services

http://server-ip/chat/  <!-- 51.120.24.144 --> 

- The chatroom page template is stored inside the WordPress theme
- The WebSocket server runs inside the api container
- Nginx handles routing:
    - / → WordPress
    - /chat → Node.js API (WebSocket + HTTP)

## 🌟Future Improvements

- User authentication system
- Moderation / report system
- Store chat history in a database
- Add HTTPS via Let's Encrypt
- Admin dashboard for viewing chat logs
